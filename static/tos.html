  <h2>Section 5: The information we collect</h2>
  <h3>Section 5.1: The official SlowGuardian deployment</h3>
  <li>
    Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using SlowGuardian's official deployment may include
    basic information such as your IP address, web traffic when using SlowGuardian, etc. This information is temporary
    and is kept until the server is rebooted.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the data collected by the official SlowGuardian
    deployment.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of minors under the age of 13 (or the minimum
    age required by laws in your country).
  </li>
  <h3>Section 5.2: Unofficial SlowGuardian Deployments</h3>
  <li>
    We can't give a definitive answer on what information is collected when you use a unofficial SlowGuardian
    deployment, only the operator of the SlowGuardian deployment you're using can.
  </li>
  <li>We urge operators to collect and store as minimal information as possible, but we can't control what they do.</li>
  <h2>Section 6: Control</h2>
  <li>
    We do not have the power to control what unofficial SlowGuardian deployment operators do with their deployment.
  </li>
  <li>
    We protect information stored on the official SlowGuardian deployment by limiting access. The only person that has
    access to the server of which the official SlowGuardian deployment runs on is the server host and the owner of
    SlowGuardian, xbubbo.
  </li>
  <li>
    We cannot check every deployment for malicious code. If any data such as your account gets compromised after you
    access it on a unofficial SlowGuardian deployment, we will not be held liable.
  </li>
  <h2>
    Section 7: How we use basic information on the official SlowGuardian deployment that may be collected accidentally
  </h2>
  <li>
    Your IP address is used to allow you to use the SlowGuardian service. This is how it works for every website you
    visit, not just SlowGuardian. The difference is whether or not this data is intentionally collected and stored.
  </li>
  <li>
    Info about your web traffic while using SlowGuardian is needed to allow you to access the service you wish to
    access.
  </li>
  <li>
    SlowGuardian will NEVER sell your info to third-parties, other than to some ad companies. We do this so we can make
    enough money to pay for our server.
  </li>
  <li>
    The official SlowGuardian server operator may respond to legal requests and assist law enforcement officials in
    legal investigations if ever needed. We can't guarantee we'll always have information to hand out as the information
    that may be collected is automatically destroyed on reboot, but if we do still have information relevent to the
    investigation, we may provide law enforcement officials with it. Please redirect all requests regarding data with an
    unofficial SlowGuardian deployment to its operator, as we don't have control over unofficial deployments and
    couldn't comply with requests even if we wanted to.
  </li>

  <li></li>
  <li>
    As a thank you for supporting SlowGuardian, you get access to supporter features. This includes a server with an
    SlowGuardian deployment for supporters only. We cannot guarantee 100% uptime.
