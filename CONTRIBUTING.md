While contributing to SlowGuardian, you need a somewhat reputable background in contributing to
JavaScript and/or HTML5 projects on Git Hub. The code you commit will be reviewed and/or reverted if
it doesn't meet SlowGuardians quality standards. Additionally, you must go through a screening
process before you are even considered to become a contributor. The pull request will be fully
reviewed by artificial intelligence, and then by a human. Once a contributor you will still need to
follow all guidelines.
